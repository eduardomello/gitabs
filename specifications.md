# GITABS

Every project has a external universe that tells a lot about what it does and what it should do. That can be bugs on a bug tracker, tasks on a project management system, specifications on a Word Document. You name it. That forces people involved in the project to use a different number of systems to support that need. But, what if all that data would be kept along with the project?

Gitableau creates an enviroment for storing all that external data along with a certain repository. 
It uses different branches to group similiar data, called meta-branches. Each branch has a different default schema that can change through time. All data is stored in JSON files. 

Gitableau is a blank slate. Through the use of templates, you can determine how you're going to store your external data.

All git operations are still available but you can relate them to specific data on your meta-branches.

Gitableau has a REST API so you can build your own application to deal with its data.
